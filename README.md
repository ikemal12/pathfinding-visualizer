# Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive pathfinding visualizer built with p5.js - it features real-time visualizations of Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, and Floyd-Warshall, showcasing how each algorithm explores the grid and finds the shortest path between two points. Users can place start/end points, draw walls, and observe the step-by-step exploration and final path tracing for each algorithm.
